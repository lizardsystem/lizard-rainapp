------------------

1.2.5 (2012-05-10)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.2.4 (2012-05-10)
------------------

- _Really_ fixes #3564 (the bug was a wrong indentation level of two
  lines -- curses, Python!)


1.2.3 (2012-05-04)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.2.2 (2012-05-04)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.2.1 (2012-05-04)
------------------

- Fixes issue #3564 (to do with the one below).


1.2 (2012-05-03)
----------------

- Only import data going 2 days back.

- In the 'rainapp_import_recent_data' management command, *always*
  import data, independent of the existence of a CompleteRainvalue
  value: because of the way 5 minute / hour / 24 hour values are
  interpolated in FEWS, they CAN CHANGE after initial import. In
  particular, some values always start out at 0 and are only correct
  to their true values several hours later.


1.1.3 (2012-03-23)
------------------

- Fixed bad UTF8 character in Waterschappen shapefile.


1.1.2 (2012-03-22)
------------------

- Removed 'CODE' field of a geoobject. It was unused, and giving
  problems at the same time.


1.1.1 (2012-03-22)
------------------

- Slugs in rainapp.cfg were wrong.


1.1 (2012-03-22)
----------------

- Added Waterschappen shapefiles, config. Using the default
  shapefiles now requires creating a RainappConfig instance in the
  admin interface.


1.0 (2012-03-22)
----------------

- Made import scripts, layers more generic so that multiple shapefiles
  can be used on the same site. This also means more configuration;
  see README.

- Added lizard-map as a dependency because rainapp depends on it.

- Added testdata and some tests.

0.9 (2012-02-09)
----------------

- Added "mm/h" besides "mm/hr".


0.8 (2012-01-12)
----------------

- Fixes bug where several locations in the same popup would have the
  same graph.


0.7 (2011-12-08)
----------------

- Fixed IE7 issue with too wide tables.

- Fixed add to collage button.

- Apparently fixed 24h issue without being aware of it
  (at least, it works now on my development system).


0.6 (2011-11-25)
----------------

- Re-enabled layer & legend, so that it can be used for individual
  municipalities (Almere, Heerhugowaard).

  RAINAPP_SHAPEFILE, RAINAPP_ID_FIELD, RAINAPP_NAME_FIELD,
  RAINAPP_CODE_FIELD, RAINAPP_X_FIELD, RAINAPP_Y_FIELD,
  RAINAPP_AREA_FIELD

  Without them, RainApp uses defaults that amount to loading the
  municipalities data.

- Settings RAINAPP_USE_SHAPES decides whether to draw the shapes
  or just user standard icons
